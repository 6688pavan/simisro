## SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE

### Overall Architecture

The Seeds Simulator implements a multi-layered architecture with clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reliability. The architecture consists of five distinct layers: Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Processing Layer, Network Layer, and Data Layer.

The Presentation Layer handles all user interface components using PyQt5, providing intuitive controls for parameter management, real-time visualization, and system monitoring. The Business Logic Layer manages core application logic, parameter validation, and system coordination. The Data Processing Layer handles waveform generation and mathematical computations using NumPy for optimal performance.

The Network Layer implements UDP multicast communication and packet management, ensuring efficient data transmission to multiple display systems simultaneously. The Data Layer manages parameter storage, configuration management, and data persistence, supporting both binary and text-based file formats.

### Multi-Threading Architecture

The system employs a sophisticated multi-threaded architecture designed for real-time performance and responsive user interaction. The threading model is based on separation of concerns, where each thread has specific responsibilities and operates independently while maintaining thread-safe communication through Qt's signal-slot mechanism.

The Main Thread (GUI Thread) handles all user interface updates, event processing, and user interactions. This thread must remain responsive to maintain 60 FPS UI performance and prevent freezing during intensive operations. All GUI operations are inherently thread-safe when performed on the main thread, ensuring consistent user experience.

The Seeder Thread (Data Generation Thread) is responsible for generating synthetic telemetry data and processing parameters in real-time. This CPU-intensive thread performs mathematical waveform calculations, parameter processing and validation, data sampling with microsecond accuracy, and real-time data structure management. The thread is optimized for up to 50 Hz sustained data generation with precise timing control.

The Sender Thread (Network Transmission Thread) handles UDP multicast transmission of generated data to multiple display systems. This thread manages network socket operations, packet formatting, transmission statistics, and error handling. It ensures reliable data delivery while maintaining network performance and handling connection issues gracefully.

**[FLOWCHART PLACEHOLDER: Multi-threading architecture diagram showing thread interactions]**

### Design Patterns and Principles

The system implements several design patterns to ensure code quality and maintainability. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates data models (Parameter classes), views (GUI components), and controllers (MainWindow coordination logic). This separation enables independent development and testing of components while maintaining clear interfaces.

The Observer pattern is used extensively for real-time data updates, where the GUI components observe changes in the data generation system and update accordingly. The Factory pattern is employed for waveform generation and parameter creation, allowing easy extension of new waveform types and parameter configurations.

The system follows SOLID principles with single responsibility classes, open-closed design for extensibility, and dependency inversion for loose coupling between components. This design ensures that the system can be easily extended with new features while maintaining existing functionality.
